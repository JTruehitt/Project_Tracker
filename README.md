# Project Tracker

## Description

For this mini project, I was tasked with building a project tracker utilizing different components of bootstrap, jQuery, day.js, and everything else Iâ€™ve learned thus far. 

In creating this application, I furthered my knowledge on the following topics:
- jQuery DOM Manipulation and traversal
- Time intervals using setInterval()
- jQuery.UI datepicker
- Bootstrap modal components
- Bootstrap form components
- General Bootstrap layout components
- Local storage, JSON 
- Creating new elements by iterating over an array or object array
- Event delegation to add functionality to dynamically created buttons
